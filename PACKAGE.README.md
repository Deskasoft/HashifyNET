HashifyNET
=================

HashifyNET is a CLS-Compliant, platform-independent .NET library designed to offer a common interface for a wide range of [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions#Keyed_cryptographic_hash_functions) and [non-cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions#Non-cryptographic_hash_functions) hashing algorithms, while also providing built-in implementations of numerous well-known hash functions.

All functionality of the library is tested using [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit). A primary requirement for each release is 100% code coverage by these tests.
All code within the library is commented using Visual Studio-compatible XML comments.
